# Twitter_sentiments

In this project, I will analyze emotions of tweets from twitter. 
The data set was obtained from kaggle.com, credit to @NIDULA ELGIRIYEWITHANA
I will mainly focus on six emotions: love, anger, fear, sadness, surprise and joy.  
This ia a great data set for analyzing social media short messages. 

The emotions have been coded in the following manner:
sadness (0), joy (1), love (2), anger (3), fear (4), and surprise (5).

First, I will conduct Sentiment Analysis: Uncover the prevailing sentiments in English Twitter messages across various emotions.
Second, I will conduct Emotion Classification: Develop models to accurately classify tweets into the six specified emotion categories.
Lastly, I will conduct Textual Analysis: Explore linguistic patterns and expressions associated with different emotional states.
